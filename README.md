# ElectroPass: A Password Manager Built with Electron and Typescript

## Introduction

I want to build a personal password manager that will be able to run natively on desktop, with only a git-like backend to host encrypted passwords. This will allow the flexibility of me hosting it on a 3rd party drive, such as Google Drive.

## Stack

Frontend: Electron + React.
Backend: SQLite DB
Encryption: AES-256
